# Test Plan: Card Layout and Click Functionality

## Fixed Issues
1. **Card Layout**: Removed problematic inline border styles that were causing cards to display as a vertical list instead of a proper grid
2. **Click Debugging**: Enhanced JavaScript with better debugging logs and user alerts

## Test Steps

### 1. Card Layout Verification
- [ ] Navigate to the Enhanced Network Discovery & Analysis modal
- [ ] Start a network scan
- [ ] Verify that host results are displayed as cards in a grid layout (not a vertical list)
- [ ] Check that cards are properly spaced and arranged in multiple columns
- [ ] Confirm PatternFly gallery layout is working correctly

### 2. Click Functionality Testing
- [ ] Complete a network scan with successful host results
- [ ] Verify that successful host cards show hover effects (border color change, box shadow)
- [ ] Click on a successful host card
- [ ] Check browser console for debugging messages
- [ ] Verify that the scan summary section updates with host-specific details
- [ ] Confirm that the "Click to view details" functionality works properly

### 3. Error Handling
- [ ] If click functionality fails, check browser console for error messages
- [ ] Verify that user-friendly alert messages are displayed
- [ ] Confirm that debugging information includes currentScanData status

## Key Changes Made

### Layout Fixes
- Removed inline `border: 2px solid` style that was breaking card flow
- Fixed mouse out handler to reset border color to empty string instead of original border color
- Added `--pf-l-gallery--GridTemplateColumns--min: 300px` to ensure proper minimum card width

### Click Functionality Improvements
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Enhanced error handling with user alerts
- Improved `currentScanData` validation
- Better error messages when scan data is unavailable

## Expected Results
- Host cards should display in a proper grid layout with multiple columns
- Clicking on successful host cards should show detailed scan information
- Hover effects should work smoothly
- Error messages should be informative and help with troubleshooting
