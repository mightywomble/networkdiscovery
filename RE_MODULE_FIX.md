# Regular Expression Module Import Fix

## 🐛 **Error Identified**
```
Report Generation Failed
cannot access local variable 're' where it is not associated with a value
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The error occurred because the `re` module was imported conditionally inside an `if` block, but then used unconditionally later in the function:

```python
# Problematic code:
if len(lines) <= 1 and len(text) > 200:
    import re  # Only imported if condition is true
    sentences = re.split(r'\. (?=[A-Z])', text)

# Later in the code (outside the if block):
if re.match(r'^\d+\.', line):  # ❌ re might not be defined!
    # ... code ...
formatted_line = re.sub(r'\*\*([^*]+)\*\*', r'<strong>\1</strong>', line)  # ❌ re might not be defined!
```

**Issue**: The `re` module was only imported when `len(lines) <= 1 and len(text) > 200` was true, but was used unconditionally later, causing a `NameError` when the condition wasn't met.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**
Moved the `import re` statement to the top of the function so it's always available:

```python
# Fixed code:
def format_text_content(text, add_paragraphs=True):
    """Helper function to format text content with proper structure"""
    import re  # ✅ Import at function start - always available
    
    if not text:
        return ""
    
    # ... rest of function can safely use re.match(), re.sub(), etc.
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Always Available**: `re` module is imported regardless of conditions
- ✅ **No NameError**: All `re.match()`, `re.sub()`, `re.split()` calls work properly  
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Function works the same way for all input types
- ✅ **Stable Formatting**: Text formatting features work reliably

## 🎯 **Expected Results**
- **No more "cannot access local variable" errors**
- **Proper text formatting** with regex patterns working correctly
- **Numbered points detection** working (e.g., "1. First point")  
- **Bold text conversion** working (e.g., "**Important**" → **Important**)
- **Header formatting** working (e.g., "### Section" → proper headers)
- **Stable report generation** without crashes

The AI reports should now process text formatting properly without the variable scope error! 🎉
