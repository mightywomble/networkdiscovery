- Agent provides detailed test results for Web UI Test Results tab
- All network scanning functions enhanced with structured output
- Compatible with existing agent configurations
- Requires restart of networkmap-agent service after deployment

VERIFICATION:
============
To verify enhanced functions on deployed host:
python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '/opt/networkmap-agent')
from networkmap_agent import NetworkMapAgent
agent = NetworkMapAgent()
tests = ['_run_system_monitoring_tests', '_run_connectivity_tests', 
         '_run_performance_tests', '_run_security_tests', '_run_discovery_tests']
all_present = all(hasattr(agent, test) for test in tests)
print('✅ All enhanced functions present' if all_present else '❌ Missing functions')
"

QUICK VERSION CHECK:
===================
python3 /opt/networkmap-agent/networkmap_agent.py --version

SERVICE MANAGEMENT:
==================
sudo systemctl status networkmap-agent
sudo systemctl restart networkmap-agent
sudo journalctl -u networkmap-agent -f
